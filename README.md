Regression model based on Theano and Lasagne, makes a linear regression with a continuous target variable.
<br />
regression.py:A Neural Network model based in Theano and Lasagne, that makes a linear regression with a continuous target variable and reaches 99.4% accuracy.
<br />
weights.py:A Neural Network model based in Theano and Lasagne, where is possible to visualize weights between X1 and X2 to hidden layer. Can also be adapted to visualize weights between hidden layer and output. It uses the DadosTeseLogit.csv sample file.
